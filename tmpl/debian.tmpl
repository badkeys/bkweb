<h3>Debian OpenSSL bug (CVE-2008-0166)</h3>

<p>In 2008 it was discovered that a patch in Debian's and Ubuntu's OpenSSL package
caused the random number generator to malfunction. Effectively this meant that
the process id (PID) was the only source of randomness.</p>

<p>This allows calculating all possible private keys generated by this vulnerable
OpenSSL package. However different behavior depending on the tool used (OpenSSL directly
vs. OpenSSH), the architecture and the presence of certain config files still
creates a number of variations. Due to these variations existing tools and lists
often miss some of these keys.</p>

<p>We check standard key sizes (1024, 2048, 3072, 4096) created on
32 and 64 bit x86 architectures, as well as ppc, with both OpenSSL and OpenSSH.
We also check ECDSA keys with the NIST P256 and P384 curves.
